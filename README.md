When growing or building a business, the cost of onboarding can be immense. One of the first risks a company can run into is providing new hires with a poor onboarding experience, leading to less successful employees that can have a negative impact on the business' success. 

One area where this is all too common is on the sales team, especially with new business development Reps (BDRs), who usually have little to no past experience in sales. If your sales pipeline is less efficient due to poor training, not only will you generate less revenue, but the proportional expense of those new hires will increase.

According to Taskdrive.com, **the average cost of hiring an in-house BDR team is around $6,000-$10,000 per SDR per month.** When you are paying that much per employee, it’s vital that they receive adequate training and feedback quickly so they can start generating revenue for your business.

Given the age of sales via video calls and demos, I built this tool to provide insight into the success of a sales team members during their meetings in order to help managers train effectively. 

Through this app managers can give the BDR insight into how their facial emotions likely appear to the prospect, and what the prospect’s likely emotion is at that point as well.
